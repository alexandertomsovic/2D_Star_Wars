# Star Wars Python V1.0 

My first 2D GUI game using python! I will be updating in the future to make this a more complete game. 

# PLEASE NOTE:

The pygame module is required to run this game. To install:

- Open your Python terminal (works in VSCODE as well)
- enter pip3 install pygame OR pip install pygame
- You should see it installing. 
- If you don't please visit www.pygame.org

# Controls: 

WASD or Arrow Keys are used for movement.
<SPACE> or <LEFT CLICK> are used to shoot the blaster.
  
# Future updates
  
This is the very first version of Star Wars Python. I plan to add a number of essential features in the coming weeks including:
  
- A health system (You're currently invincible)
- A character selection system so youn aren't locked to a stormtrooper
- New levels and a scoring system
  
 Have Fun!
